    static: This is the default position, and elements are placed in the normal document flow.

    relative: The position is based on the element's normal location; this allows for moving elements relative to their original position.
    
    absolute: The element is removed from the normal flow and can be positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor element.
    
    fixed: The element is fixed in place, does not move with the normal flow, and always stays in the same position when the page is scrolled.
    
    sticky: This is a combination of static and fixed; the element becomes fixed when it reaches its maximum position. -->

    <!-- static - default, does nothing -->
    <!-- relative - Move elements relative to their original position -->
    <!-- absolute - put the element on a whole new layer, separate from the rest -->
    <!-- fixed - Keep important information or controls visible to the user at all times -->
    <!-- sticky - Elements that act like static until a certain scroll position is reached, then become fixed -->
