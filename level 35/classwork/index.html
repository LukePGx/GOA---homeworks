<!-- static - this is a default value -->
<!-- absolute - puts the item on an a different layer, different "dimension" -->
<!-- relative - does same thing, but only from the spot it was at in the first place -->
<!-- fixed - this value makes it so even if we scroll down, the element will stay on the same spot on our screens -->
<!-- sticky - It acts like relative until a specified scroll position is reached, then it behaves like fixed -->
